# Vibe to Prod - Roadmap

## Quick Validation Strategy

Ship fast, test demand, iterate. Don't over-engineer before validation.

---

## Phase 1: MVP (Target: 1 week)

### Goal
Create minimal sellable product to test market demand.

### Deliverables

**Template Repository**
- [ ] Minimal Go backend (health check API only)
- [ ] Minimal iOS app (single screen, API connection)
- [ ] Minimal Android app (single screen, API connection)
- [ ] Basic CI/CD (build verification)
- [ ] Claude Code configuration (the value)
- [ ] OpenSpec framework (change management)
- [ ] README with setup instructions

**Notion Workspace**
- [ ] Duplicate proofmi Notion workspace
- [ ] Remove proofmi-specific content
- [ ] Genericize examples
- [ ] Keep workflows, checklists, architecture patterns

**Sales Infrastructure**
- [ ] Gumroad product page
- [ ] GitHub webhook for collaborator access
- [ ] Purchase confirmation with Notion template link

### Validation Criteria
- 3+ sales in first week
- OR 50+ waitlist signups
- OR clear qualitative feedback "I would buy this"

---

## Phase 2: Polish (If validated)

### Goal
Improve based on initial feedback.

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] More comprehensive CI/CD (all platforms)
- [ ] OpenAPI workflow integration
- [ ] Multiple environment support (dev/prod)
- [ ] Secrets management guide
- [ ] Video walkthrough

---

## Phase 3: Scale (If product-market fit)

### Goal
Maximize reach and revenue.

### Activities
- [ ] Blog content (SEO + thought leadership)
- [ ] Landing page optimization
- [ ] Additional pricing tiers
- [ ] Affiliate program
- [ ] Template variants (e.g., web-only, API-only)

---

## Anti-Goals

Things we explicitly WON'T do before validation:

1. Perfect documentation
2. Video tutorials
3. Multiple stack variants
4. Custom landing page
5. Email sequences
6. Extensive marketing

These can come AFTER we know people will pay.
