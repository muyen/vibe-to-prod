# Vibe to Production - Business Plan

**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Status**: Quick Validation Phase

---

## The Opportunity

Many developers can "vibe-code" features with AI help, but hit a wall when trying to ship. The gap between "it works" and "it's in production" is where they struggle.

## Product Definition

### What We're Selling

A **private GitHub repo access + Notion workspace template** that gives developers:

1. **Production-Ready Codebase**
   - Go backend with health check API
   - iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI)
   - Android app (Kotlin/Compose)
   - CI/CD pipelines that work

2. **AI-Native Development Workflow**
   - Claude Code fully configured
   - Hooks for quality gates
   - Skills for common tasks
   - Custom agents for each platform

3. **Documentation & Process**
   - Notion workspace template
   - Deployment checklists
   - Architecture guides
   - Runbooks

### Unique Selling Point

The **Claude Code configuration** is genuinely novel. Most templates compete on "what frameworks are included" - we compete on "how you work with AI."
