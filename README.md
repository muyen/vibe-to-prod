# Vibe to Prod

**From Vibe Coding to Production in Days, Not Months**

This is a meta-repository for creating the "Vibe to Production" starter kit - a sellable template bundle for developers who want to go from AI-assisted prototyping to production-ready applications.

## What is This?

This repo contains:
- `/docs` - Business plan, roadmap, session logs
- `/template` - The actual product (GitHub template)
- `/marketing` - Landing page, blog content
- `/.claude` - Claude Code configuration for this project

## The Product

A private GitHub template + Notion workspace that gives developers:

1. **Production-Ready Codebase** - Go backend + iOS + Android
2. **AI-Native Workflow** - Claude Code fully configured
3. **Documentation** - Notion workspace with guides and checklists

## Quick Start

```bash
# Read session context
cat docs/SESSION_LOG.md

# See current roadmap
cat docs/ROADMAP.md

# See business plan
cat docs/BUSINESS_PLAN.md
```

## Development

This project uses Claude Code with:
- Session logging hooks (auto-context between sessions)
- Commit formatting commands
- Proofmi extraction skills

### Session Workflow

1. On session start: Read `docs/SESSION_LOG.md`
2. During session: Use TodoWrite to track progress
3. On session end: Update `docs/SESSION_LOG.md`

## Status

**Phase**: Pre-MVP (Setup)
**Goal**: Quick validation - ship fast, test demand
