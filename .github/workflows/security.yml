# Security Scanning Workflow
# Runs on every push and weekly
#
# NOTE: This workflow is optimized for PRIVATE repos:
# - SARIF uploads require GitHub Advanced Security (paid)
# - Dependency Review requires GitHub Advanced Security (paid)
# - govulncheck warns but doesn't fail (stdlib vulns require Go version upgrades)
