# Deep Analysis and Problem Solving Mode

Deep analysis and problem solving mode

## Instructions

1. **Initialize Ultra Think Mode**
   - Acknowledge the request for enhanced analytical thinking
   - Set context for deep, systematic reasoning
   - Prepare to explore the problem space comprehensively

2. **Parse the Problem or Question**
   - Extract the core challenge from: $ARGUMENTS
   - Identify all stakeholders and constraints
   - Recognize implicit requirements and hidden complexities
   - Question assumptions and surface unknowns

3. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
   Approach the problem from multiple angles:

   ### Technical Perspective
   - Analyze technical feasibility and constraints
   - Consider scalability, performance, and maintainability
   - Evaluate security implications
   - Assess technical debt and future-proofing

   ### Business Perspective
   - Understand business value and ROI
   - Consider time-to-market pressures
   - Evaluate competitive advantages
   - Assess risk vs. reward trade-offs

   ### User Perspective
   - Analyze user needs and pain points
   - Consider usability and accessibility
   - Evaluate user experience implications
   - Think about edge cases and user journeys

   ### System Perspective
   - Consider system-wide impacts
   - Analyze integration points
   - Evaluate dependencies and coupling
   - Think about emergent behaviors

4. **Generate Multiple Solutions**
   - Brainstorm at least 3-5 different approaches
   - For each approach, consider:
     - Pros and cons
     - Implementation complexity
     - Resource requirements
     - Potential risks
     - Long-term implications
   - Include both conventional and creative solutions
   - Consider hybrid approaches

5. **Synthesize Insights**
   - Combine insights from all perspectives
   - Identify key decision factors
   - Highlight critical trade-offs
   - Present a nuanced view of the problem space

6. **Provide Structured Recommendations**
   Present findings in a clear structure:
   ```
   ## Problem Analysis
   - Core challenge
   - Key constraints
   - Critical success factors

   ## Solution Options
   ### Option 1: [Name]
   - Description
   - Pros/Cons
   - Implementation approach

   ## Recommendation
   - Recommended approach
   - Rationale
   - Next steps
   ```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Product decision
/ultra-think Should we add feature X or focus on polish?

# Pricing strategy
/ultra-think What price point maximizes revenue while filtering for serious buyers?

# Technical choice
/ultra-think Should we include OpenAPI workflow or keep it simpler?
```
