# Ultra Think Mode

Deep analysis and problem solving mode for complex decisions.

**Problem/Question**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Instructions

1. **Initialize Ultra Think Mode**
   - Acknowledge the request for enhanced analytical thinking
   - Set context for deep, systematic reasoning
   - Prepare to explore the problem space comprehensively

2. **Parse the Problem**
   - Extract the core challenge
   - Identify all stakeholders and constraints
   - Recognize implicit requirements
   - Question assumptions and surface unknowns

3. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**

   ### Technical Perspective
   - Analyze technical feasibility and constraints
   - Consider scalability, performance, maintainability
   - Evaluate security implications
   - Assess technical debt and future-proofing

   ### User Perspective
   - Analyze user needs and pain points
   - Consider usability and accessibility
   - Evaluate user experience implications
   - Think about edge cases and user journeys

   ### System Perspective
   - Consider system-wide impacts
   - Analyze integration points
   - Evaluate dependencies and coupling
   - Think about emergent behaviors

4. **Generate Multiple Solutions**
   - Brainstorm at least 3-5 different approaches
   - For each approach, consider:
     - Pros and cons
     - Implementation complexity
     - Resource requirements
     - Potential risks
   - Include both conventional and creative solutions
   - Consider hybrid approaches

5. **Synthesize Insights**
   - Combine insights from all perspectives
   - Identify key decision factors
   - Highlight critical trade-offs
   - Present a nuanced view of the problem space

6. **Provide Structured Recommendations**

```
