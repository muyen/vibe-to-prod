# Why This Project Is Open Source

## The Short Answer

Because trust comes before transactions.

---

## The Longer Answer

### Templates Are Trust Products

When you use a template, you're trusting that:
- The architecture is sound
- The code is production-ready
- The patterns are worth following
- The maintainer knows what they're doing

How do you verify any of that behind a paywall?

You can't.

### Open Source Is Proof of Work

By making this open source:
- You can read every line of code
- You can see the commit history
- You can judge the decisions for yourself
- You can run it, break it, fix it

If the code is bad, you'll know. If it's good, you'll know that too.

No marketing required. The code speaks.

### Secrecy Adds No Value Here

Production templates don't benefit from being secret:
- The patterns are known
- The tools are documented
- The value is in the assembly, not the mystery

Hiding this behind a paywall would only slow adoption and reduce feedback.

### Community Makes It Better

Open source means:
- Bug reports from real usage
- PRs from people who actually ship
- Scrutiny that improves quality
- A reputation that compounds

A closed template stays frozen. An open one evolves.

## What About Money?

Open source doesn't mean the maintainer starves.

Possible paths:
- **Sponsorships** — If this helps you, consider supporting
- **Paid setup** — Need help deploying? I can consult
- **Premium add-ons** — Advanced features, if demand exists
- **Education** — Courses, deep dives, workshops

But none of that comes first.

First: build something worth using.
Then: see if people want more.

## The Philosophy

> "Make something people want to use. The rest follows."

This project is open source because that's the fastest way to prove it's real.

Use it. Fork it. Ship it. Build something real.
